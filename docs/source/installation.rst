Installation
============

Since nxtIDE aims to be the only thing you need to play with robots in Python, its installation aims to be as simple as possible. In general it only depends on the following dependences:

- Python 2.7
- wxpython
- pygame

This means that Python should be all you need to run nxtIDE. However,
to make it easier for users on some platforms to use it, there are
installers available to facilitate the installation process.
